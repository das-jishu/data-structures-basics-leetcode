# INVERT A BINARY TREE

Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

     4
   -   -
  2     7
 - -   - -
1   3 6   9
Output:

     4
   -   -
  7     2
 - -   - -
9   6 3   1

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
