# ALL PATHS FROM SOURCE TO TARGET

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).

Example 1:

Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.

Example 2:

Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]

Example 3:

Input: graph = [[1],[]]
Output: [[0,1]]

Example 4:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,2,3],[0,3]]

Example 5:

Input: graph = [[1,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,3]]
 
Constraints:

n == graph.length
2 <= n <= 15
0 <= graph[i][j] < n
graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
